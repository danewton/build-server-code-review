For installation, copy the existing mvn install to mvn.orig, put the mvn.delegate script in its place, 
and then update it to point to your local install of the build-server-code-review scripts.  Enjoy!!!
 
 cp $MVN_HOME/bin/{mvn,mvn.orig}
 cp bin/mvn.delegate $MVN_HOME/bin/mvn
 vim $MVN_HOME/bin/mvn
