# to run, do an "svn checkout" of your favorite project, then generate a dependencies file
svn co $SVN/foo/trunk foo
mvn dependency:tree > dependencies.txt 2>&1

# then simply run the code-review script, passing along any arguments that you would have passed to mvn
/opt/projects/build-server-code-review/bin/code-reviews.sh clean package

# since more rules are triggered on a release build, this is a good way to test
mvn dependency:tree > dependencies.txt 2>&1 && /opt/projects/build-server-code-review/bin/code-reviews.sh clean release:prepare



If you are ever feel froggy, and decide to try to refactor some of the scripts under the bin directory
that have output files, and $$ files, be sure to review the output closely.  Any output for a rule's
findings should be printed out just below the rules-name/status line ... not sporadically within the
output.
